				This chapter looks at the topic of data structures, which is concerned with the various ways data can be organized within a computer program.  This subject should not be confused with databases, which were discussed in Chapter <span class="contentNum information false"></span>.  Remember that databases are applications for organizing and storing large quantities of information in a flexible manner so that people can ask questions about that data.  In contrast, data structures are internal program objects that enable data to be manipulated efficiently by computer programs.
			</p>

			<p>
				This chapter is organized in the following way.  After this introduction, Section <span class="contentNum structuresData false"></span> presents five of the most common “higher-level” data structures.  These include: stacks, queues, general lists, trees, and graphs.  These structures are “higher-level” in the sense that they are not generally included as built-in components of programming languages.  Instead, they must be implemented by programmers using the statements and “lower-level” data structures provided by the programming languages.  In Section 7.3 we take a look at three common lower-level data structures: variables, arrays, and records.  This section also introduces three data types common to most programming languages: integers, reals, and character strings.
			</p>

			<p>
				Section 7.4 describes, in general terms, how the higher-level data structures of Section <span class="contentNum structuresData false"></span>  may be implemented by using the lower-level data structures of Section 7.3, together with simple algorithms of the type discussed in Chapter <span class="contentNum algorithms false"></span>.  The final section of this chapter looks at the topic of Abstract Data Types which is illustrated using a stack.  Emphasis is placed on understanding why this topic is important from a computing standpoint.
