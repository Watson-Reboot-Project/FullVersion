				<span>An R-S flip-flop can be constructed from two interconnected</span> <span class="Ital">nor</span> <span>gates. <span class="figNum channeltwo"></span> illustrates such an R-S flip-flop. As discussed in <span class="contentNum circuitsFundamentals4"></span>, a</span> <span class="Ital">nor</span> <span>is simply an</span> <span class="Ital">or</span> <span>gate followed by a</span> <span class="Ital">not</span> <span>gate. For clarity, <span class="figNum channeltwo"></span> shows the two</span> <span class="Ital">nor</span> <span>gates of the flip-flop as having been decomposed into their underlying</span> <span class="Ital">or</span> <span>and</span> <span class="Ital">not</span> <span>gates.</span>

				<span class="figNum channelthree"></span> An R-S flip-flop holding a “1”
			</p>

			<p>
				R-S flip-flops have two inputs and two outputs. The inputs are usually labeled R for “Reset” and S for “Set”. The outputs are traditionally labeled Q and Q, or “not Q”. Q is the complement, or opposite, of Q, so if Q is “1” then Q should be “0”, and vice versa.
			</p>

			<p>
				The Q output of the flip-flop determines its state. In other words, examining the Q output is the same as seeing what is stored in the bit. The state can be a binary “1” (Set) or a binary “0” (Reset). When a flip-flop like the R-S is in one of its states (Set or Reset), it will remain unchanged until an appropriate signal or pulse is applied to one of its input lines. The ability of a flip-flop to hold the Q output constant until a signal is given to change the value of Q is why flip-flops are considered basic memory devices.
			</p>

			<p>
				We begin our detailed analysis of the R-S flip-flop assuming that Q is initially high (“1”), and both R and S are low (“0”), as shown in <span class="figNum channelthree"></span>. Since both of the inputs to the top <span class="Ital">or</span> <span>gate are low, its output is low, and the output of the top</span> <span class="Ital">not</span> <span>gate (the Q signal) is high. This high output is fed back into the input of the bottom</span> <span class="Ital">or</span> <span>gate making its output</span> <span>high and the output of the</span> <span class="Ital">not</span>gate (the Q signal) low. This is a stable circuit. While R and S remain low, Q will remain high and Q low. The bit is thus holding a “1”.
			</p>

			<p>
				If we apply a “1” to the R (reset) input, in order to place a “0” into the bit, the following events occur. The output of the top <span class="Ital">nor</span> <span>gate (the Q signal) goes low, this is fed back to the input of the bottom</span> <span class="Ital">nor</span> <span>gate, which causes its output (the Q signal) to go high. This signal is fed back to the top</span> <span class="Ital">nor</span>gate, but since it already has another high input there is no change in the output – it remains low. This is a stable circuit, as shown in <span class="figNum rsflipflop"></span>. The flip-flop has been reset to “0”.
			</p>

			<p class="Figure">
				<span class="figNum rsflipflop"></span> An R-S flip-flop reset to “0”
			</p>

			<p>
				If the reset signal is removed (set to low), the flip-flop remains in the reset, “0”, state since there is still a “1” input to the top <span class="Ital">nor</span> gate from the Q input. This is shown in <span class="figNum rsflipflopone"></span>. Note that this is exactly the behavior we desire. In order for the flip-flop to be useful, it must be able to “remember” that it has been reset to “0” even after the reset signal is removed.
			</p>

			<p>
				<span>Now we apply a high signal to the S (set) input, in order to set the bit to “1”. This action causes the following events to occur. The output of the bottom</span> <span class="Ital">nor</span> <span>gate becomes 0 since one of its inputs is now high. This low signal is applied as an input to the top</span> <span class="Ital">nor</span> <span>gate, where the R input is also low. The output of the top</span> <span class="Ital">nor</span> <span>is forced high, and this high output is fed back into the bottom</span> <span class="Ital">nor</span> <span>gate, which does not change its state since its other input was already high. The flip-flop has been set to “1”, as can be seen in <span class="figNum rsflipflopreset"></span>.</span>
			</p>

			<p class="Figure">
				<span class="figNum rsflipflopreset"></span> An R-S flip-flop set to “1”
			</p>

			<p>
				<span>Next, we remove the set signal. In other words, we put the S input back to low. This action does not change the output of the bottom</span> <span class="Ital">nor</span> <span>gate since its other input is already high and the circuit remains in the set state, as shown in <span class="figNum rsflipflopzero"></span>. Thus, once an R-S flip-flop receives a pulse, or “1”, down its set line, it will continue to hold that “1” until a reset signal (“1” down the reset line) is received. </span>
			</p>

			<p>
				<span>Notice that state of the flip-flop shown in <span class="figNum rsflipflopzero"></span> is identical to its original state given in <span class="figNum channelthree"></span>. They both represent the flip-flop in its “1” state, with “0” on both input lines. Comparing <span class="figNum rsflipflopone"></span> and <span class="figNum rsflipflopzero"></span> illustrates another feature of flip-flops. That is that the value output by the circuit is</span> <span class="Ital">not</span> <span>solely dependent on its current inputs. When the R and S inputs are both low, “0”, the value output on the Q line depends on whether the most recent high, “1”, input was on the set line or the reset line. <span class="figNum rsflipflopone"></span> shows the circuit outputting a “0” on Q, because the most recent input</span> <span>operation was “reset”. <span class="figNum rsflipflopzero"></span> shows the circuit outputting a “1”, because the most recent input operation was “set”.</span>

			</p>

			<p>
				There is one other possible configuration of inputs we have not yet considered. What happens if both the R and S inputs are set to high at the same time – corresponding to an attempt to simultaneously store both a “0” and a “1” into a single bit? &nbsp;This is pictured in <span class="figNum rsflipflopsetone"></span>. The outputs do remain constant, but the R-S flip-flop is not in a valid state because Q and Q have identical values, yet they are always supposed to be the opposite of one another.
			</p>

			<p>
				We conclude this introduction to the R-S flip-flop with its truth table.

				<li>
					<p>
						Having the R and S values both be “1” at the same time <span>creates an “undesirable” state for the R-S flip-flop. What combinational circuit would help us test whether the inputs to the R-S flip-flop are “desirable” or “undesirable”?</span>&nbsp;
