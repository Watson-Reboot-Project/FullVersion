				From the earliest days of computing, humans have been fascinated by the prospect of constructing intelligent machines. This chapter introduces the field of artificial intelligence. <span class="Bolded">Artificial intelligence</span> (AI) is a branch of computer science that has as its goal the construction of a general-purpose intelligence â€“ of constructing machines that are capable of doing all of the things which, at the present time, people are better. Some of the topics associated with the field of AI include creating machines that can: see and recognize objects in the real world, including people; converse fluently in human languages, such as English, and translate between different human languages; safely drive a car; plan and reason as people do; play strategy games like chess or Go, and knowledge games like <span class="Ital">Jeopardy!</span>; display creativity and discover new knowledge. Essentially, AI seeks to make computers more like people.
			</p>

			<p>
				<span class="contentNum intelligenceOverview"></span> provides an overview of artificial intelligence including the goals of the field, its underlying assumptions, a brief history of the field, and a summary of progress to date in a number of areas. <span class="contentNum intelligenceApproaches"></span> describes a variety of topics that have been studied in the effort to achieve intelligent behavior in machines, including: game playing and search, automated reasoning, and neural networks and machine learning. The presentation of these topics is independent from one another, so the instructor and/or student can pick and choose which areas are of interest.
