			</p>
			
			<p>
				<span class="Bolded">Hacking</span> generally refers to methods for gaining unauthorized access to computing resources.  The “dictionary hack”, discussed in <span class="contentNum ethicalPublic1b1"></span>, is an example of a hack that can be used to obtain account passwords.  Trojan horses and viruses represent two other types of hacks. 			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				A <span class="Bolded">Trojan horse</span> consists of a covert program that hides within another, seemingly innocent, program.  One popular type of Trojan horse tricks unsuspecting users into giving out their password, by masquerading as a system login prompt.  When such a program is running, the computer (or terminal) appears to be unused.  Thus, as users try to log in by typing their account names and passwords, the Trojan horse will record this information for its owner.  After a “victim” has entered his or her password, the Trojan horse either allows the victim to log in normally or “fakes” a network problem or some other type of error.  Other types of Trojan horses are more malicious.  They contain “code bombs” which can do nasty things, such as corrupt the files on a disk drive.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<span class="Bolded">Viruses</span> are self-replicating computer programs that attach themselves to disk files and email messages.  They are generally spread from computer to computer by networks or infected floppy disks.  Some viruses are mostly harmless – limiting their mischief to displaying annoying messages.  Other viruses are more serious, and can damage or destroy the contents of infected files.  Unfortunately, creating programs such as Trojan horses and viruses that exhibit destructive behavior is not very difficult.  All it takes is a smattering of programming and systems knowledge, plus a willingness to engage in socially deviant behavior.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				For the most part, hackers mean no harm.  Typically, they are young men (15-25) who are bright underachievers.  Most exhibit a profound lack of social skills.  From their point of view, hacking is seen as a way to show off how clever they are.  To them, hacking is a game, a stimulating contest of wits with the sys admins (the administrative personnel who run the computer systems).  Winning the game gives the hacker a sense of power.  It validates their sense of self worth.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				From the point of view of most systems personnel, hackers are dweebs who need to grow up, get a life, and stop causing them headaches.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				What would-be hackers need to realize is that their actions cause real damage that costs real money to repair.  Even relatively benign hacks (that just print silly messages) interrupt work and take time to correct.  When a systems administrator who makes $60,000 a year ends up spending most of a day stamping out a viral infection or going through logs to track down who is responsible for a break-in, that translates into about $250.  If data files are damaged – either accidentally or intentionally – they must be restored from backup and all changes since the last backup reentered.  Such an incident can easily cost an organization, such as a business or university, many thousands of dollars.  It doesn’t take many kids “just having fun” for this situation to cost <span class="Ital">real</span> money. 			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Hackers need to be aware that if and when they are caught, the outside world will not consider their actions to be part of a game.  They will be charged with real crimes and subject to real penalties.  People go to jail, even for “innocent” hacking.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				I’ll close this section by saying that while the hacking problem is certainly real, in the opinion of this author it has been blown way out of proportion by the media.  Painting pictures of impending doom helps sell newspapers and magazines, and boosts ratings – not to mention the sales of virus protection software.  But, in two decades of extensive interaction with computer systems I have never, to my knowledge, lost a program or data file as a result of a hack, even though I take no extraordinary precautions to protect against them.<span class="Footnote" title="Footnote: "><a href="#ftn8" id="body_ftn8">[8]</a></span>
