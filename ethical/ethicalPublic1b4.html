				In addition to raising privacy issues for newer forms of communication, such as email and instant messaging, the widespread application of computing technology is also calling into question the collating and widespread dissemination of “public” information about individuals. 			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Before computers existed, it was possible to collect all sorts of personal information about individuals, such as their names, addresses, phone numbers, income levels, spending habits, etc.  Much of this information could be gleaned from property records and various licenses that are, by law, matters of public record in many states.  Even though compiling detailed dossiers has been possible for many years, it was rarely done due to the enormous expense involved in collecting and organizing such information by hand.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Computers have made compiling detailed personal profiles simple and inexpensive.  Reverse telephone books ordered by prefix, zip code, and street address make it easier to target particular ethnic, racial, and income groups.  Every time you subscribe to a magazine, or contribute to a political or humanitarian cause, your name is entered onto a list.  These lists are routinely bought and sold.  Every time you use your credit card to purchase a product, buy an airline ticket, rent a car or hotel room, or even eat in a restaurant, records are kept.  When you check out at the supermarket every single product you buy can be recorded.  If you pay by credit card or even by personal check, that list of items can be linked to your consumer profile.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				While none of this information is very “personal”, the total sum of it can tell you a lot about a person – the things they value, whether they are fiscally conservative, what their political orientation is, their religious beliefs, their marital status, what their favorite brand of beer is and even whether they drink too much of it.  In short, computers make it possible for organizations to know more about people than many individuals feel comfortable with.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The kinds of personal information that ought to be freely bought and sold is still largely unresolved.  At the moment, the prevailing rule seems to be that companies may legally do what they like with the information they collect.  Public pressure, however, appears to prevent most companies from abusing the information they collect.
