				In the above discussion, we asked whether citizens have the right to encrypt their data and email.  Even if the answer to that question is “yes”, the fact is that the vast majority of data and email today are not encrypted.  Does the government have the right to monitor unencrypted email?  It is a commonly held belief among many Internet users that the National Security Agency routinely monitors Internet traffic.  Whether or not this is true, it does show the level of concern that many people express over privacy issues.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Do employers have the right to monitor their employees’ email when that mail is sent over company equipment during working hours?  Prevailing law says yes.  The employer clearly must have some means of making sure employees are doing the job for which they are being paid.  Employers need to be sure that employees are not giving away company secrets, or gossiping with friends on company time.  Furthermore, employers generally own the data files that their employees produce while at work, so surely the employer may inspect such files.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Things become a bit more complicated when the question at hand is whether an employer can monitor an employee’s communications during their personal time.  The accepted standard currently tends to be that yes your employer can monitor communications sent on your personal time if you are using equipment provided by your employer – a company issued mobile smart phone, for example.  Note that even if you paid for your own smart phone, any text messages you might send during your lunch hour could still be fair game for your employer to access if your phone connects to the Internet through your employer’s wireless network.  Because many smart phones automatically connect to the nearest available wi-fi connection, there is concern among some that it is becoming overly complex for individuals to know whether or not a text message or Skype call can legally be considered private or not. 			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				As another example, would you agree that university administrators have the right to monitor their students’ email and other forms of communication when the underlying data is sent over university equipment?  While many students might disagree, universities do have the legal right to do so.    While students are not employees of the university, they do use university computing equipment to perform their “work”.  Students, in a sense, represent their university.  If a student were to post a sexually explicit photo on the Internet using the university’s computer system and that photo ended up on the cover of Time or Newsweek, the university could suffer from adverse publicity.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				What if faculty members or administrators had reason to believe that a group of students were engaged in unethical activities (such as exchanging copies of next week’s history exam) or illegal activities (such as hacking into sensitive government computing facilities) – should they be allowed access to those students’ email messages and data files in order to investigate the situation?  Again, prevailing law says yes.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Next time you log on to your university’s computer network, carefully read the computer usage policy.  You may be surprised to discover that your university retains the right to look at all of the documents you have stored on their systems, regardless of the nature of those documents.  It is also unlikely that your university guarantees (in any legally enforceable manner) to protect your documents from unauthorized access.  In fact, in order to install and maintain software, most computer systems must have a special class of user, known as super users, who have unrestricted access to all files stored on those systems.  Without super user access, your university’s systems personnel could not do their jobs.  However, with such access they have the ability to read any and all unencrypted documents stored on the system – including private email, if they so choose.  This is one reason why great care must be exercised in selecting trustworthy systems personnel.

				These questions of privacy are not limited to university students and corporate employees.  These days we all use online services such as Facebook, Twitter, Gmail, Skype, YouTube, Google, Amazon, iTunes, and many others.  All of these sites record information about us and update that information every time we access them.  What sort of privacy protections are we legally entitled to?  The answer is “very few”.  While there has been a push in Europe to give individuals legal rights over data they post and data that is collected about them, as of 2012 there is no such legislative push in the United States.  Instead, companies are simply required to inform their customers of the policies the companies themselves have established.  In some cases individuals may “opt out” of some kinds of information sharing but the onus is squarely on the consumer to actively protect their privacy and the options for doing so are often limited.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Before the widespread deployment of the Internet people used to worry about the government collecting data on its citizenry.  Novels such as “1984” painted bleak pictures of the dangers of all seeing, all knowing “Big Brother” governments.  While modern democracies have strict laws designed to protect individual privacy, the rise of ubiquitous computing and communications technologies present challenges to the very notion of privacy.

				In the second decade of the 21st century, our smart phones have embedded GPS – which makes applications like Google Maps and Turn-by-Turn directions possible, but also enable continuous tracking of our location.   Many of us would find it quite difficult to adjust to life without Google search and the Internet – but we are concerned that when we perform a search or click on a link we almost inevitably leave “digital footprints” behind.  Many of us love to update our Facebook status and post party pics for our friends to enjoy, but are uncomfortable that Facebook retains this data.  Debit and credit cards make life much more convenient, but every time we use another record is added to our purchase history.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				There is nothing nefarious behind this drive to collect and retain data.  Online service provides simply want to deliver narrowly targeted advertisements to consumers and thus the more they know about you – like your age, gender, income and educational level, interests, purchase histories, religion, marital status, sexual preference, physical location, etc. – the more they can target the ads they feed you. 			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Many individuals feel a strong desire for more control over the data they post or that is collected about them.  Some argue for individual “ownership” of “their” data. 			
			</p>		
			
			<p>
				Talk about ease of government in obtaining warrants, or “letters of ……”  and corporations roll over.  Some claim industry in the name of more targeted advertising has amassed data that is trivially avaialbe to government.  Government doesn’t have to collect the data because industry does it for them.  People willing trade their information for convenience.  Where will it end
