			</p>
			
			<p>
				The first decade of the 21<sup>st</sup> century has witnessed the rise, or more accurately the explosion, of a new form of “software” piracy – the “trading” (i.e., illegal copying) of music and (to an increasing degree) video files.  The reasons for this phenomenon are complex, but include, in part, the widespread penetration of broadband Internet connections combined with the rapid adoption of the MP3 music compression format.  
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Instant messaging programs that support file transfer make “giving” a copy of a song to someone thousands of miles away almost as simple as handing the CD to someone in the same room.  Assuming that both the sender and receiver are connected to the Internet via a cable or DSL modem, a copy of a song can be transferred from one computer to another in about the same amount of time it takes to play the song – regardless of the physical distance between the sender and receiver.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				In addition to instant messaging applications, distributed peer-to-peer networks like KaZaA, Morpheus, Bearshare, and BitTorrent encourage the widespread illegal copying of copyrighted material by providing listings of, and links to, available material.  These programs also enable the “trading” of movies and episodes of popular TV shows by allowing a computer to download multiple parts of a video or music file simultaneously from different servers – substantially improving download times. 			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				However, even with cable and DSL modems – a reasonable quality MPEG encoded movie (one with somewhat less quality than that of a VCR tape) can still require six hours or more to fully download.  This extended download time currently limits the popularity of video piracy.  As available bandwidth continues to increase, media companies are becoming more and more concerned that video copyright will soon face the same challenges that music now faces.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Exacerbating the music and video piracy problem is the fact that playback of downloaded music and video is not limited to computers.  Downloaded files can be burned to CD and DVD, enabling music to be played on traditional CD players and movies to be played on DVD players.  Additionally, portable music players can store and playback songs encoded in the MP3 file format, allowing pirated music to be played while “on the go”.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				In many ways, music and video piracy is similar to traditional software piracy.  However, unlike as is the case with software piracy, music and video pirates usually don’t even attempt to justify their actions – instead admitting they are breaking copyright law.  Thus one wonders why millions of people who would never think of committing traditional forms of theft, trade MP3s with abandon.  Perhaps people are so used to “free” music via commercial radio, “free” video via broadcast television, and “unlimited” access to movies (including taping privileges) via cable that the idea that it is “wrong” to trade movies and music online just has not taken root.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Some have suggested that the ultimate solution to the media piracy problem lies in music companies adopting a consumer model similar to that of cable TV – one in which customers would “subscribe” to music.  Such a subscription would give an individual access to the entire music catalog owned (or licensed) by the service.  The concept could even be extended to multiple levels of subscriptions – with consumers paying more to have access to the very latest releases.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Whatever the ultimate solution to this problem turns out to be, music and video pirates need to understand that while the likelihood of prosecution is low, trading MP3’s and videos online does constitute copyright infringement and is illegal.  As with software piracy, the defense that “everyone else is doing it” does not hold up in court.
