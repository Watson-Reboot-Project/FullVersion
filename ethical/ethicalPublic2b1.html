				Traditional forms of mass communication such as radio, broadcast television, and to a lesser extent print, have restrictions on what is considered acceptable “speech”.  For example, there are certain words and phrases that may not be used on broadcast television.  Nudity and explicit scenes of sexual intercourse are taboo.  Even in print media, certain publications may not be available for purchase everywhere, due to the existence of local laws banning their sale.  In addition, newspapers and magazines are routinely sued for circulating unsubstantiated stories of a damaging nature.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Currently, there are very few restrictions on what is considered permissible speech on the Internet.  To understand why this is so, we need to examine the rationale for the limited speech approach of television and other media, and compare that to the technological and social factors underlying the Internet.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Traditional media, such as radio and television, are, by their very nature, “broadcast” technologies in which the number of information providers is relatively small, and the number of people receiving the information is very large.  Devices for receiving the signals are mass produced and inexpensive.  Transmission equipment, on the other hand, is quite expensive.  Thus most everyone can listen, but few can speak.  To a somewhat lesser extent this same situation exists with print media.  While anyone can afford to buy a newspaper, few people could afford to print and distribute their own.	
			</p>
			
			<p>
				In recent years, word processors, laser printers, and photocopiers, have helped to increase the power of the individual to be “heard” via the written word.  But few would claim that everyone has equal access to the printing press.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The situation in regard to allowing the individual to be heard via traditional radio and television is unlikely to improve.  Only a limited number of channels are available due to the underlying broadcast technology.  This is because each radio station and television channel is transmitted over a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum and there is only so much to go around.  Stations that are located physically near one another must be on different channels to avoid interference.  And the range of each station is limited.  Hence most areas of the country have access to only a handful of over-the-air channels.  While cable and direct broadcast satellites have increased the number of available channels to a few hundred or so, this is still an insignificant number compared to the vast audience they must serve.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Because of the basic asymmetry between broadcasters on one hand, and the viewers and listeners on the other, the speech that is permitted by the broadcaster is regulated.  The Federal Communications Commission, the FCC, awards broadcast licenses to radio and television stations.  In exchange for a license to use the public airways, stations must pledge to operate in the public interest and conform to community standards.  In order to establish that they are acting in the public interest, stations often produce material of local interest, such as state and regional news program and public affairs shows.  Stations must be perceived as generally fair and unbiased in their presentation of issues, and work to ensure that a variety of views are represented.  Conforming to community standards means that material deemed by the local community to be “obscene” or patently offensive must be avoided.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The Internet grew up under an entirely different set of circumstances.  The most striking technological difference is that the basic asymmetry that exists between information producers and information consumers in traditional media is absent on the Internet.  While the bandwidth of the Internet is finite, there is no concept of “channel”.  The closest analogy is a web site, and there is no limit to the number of web sites that can be constructed.  The cost barriers that limit an individual’s ability to be heard in traditional media are much lower on the Internet.  For about $20 per month, anyone with access to a telephone and modem equipped computer can connect to the Internet via an Internet Service Provider (ISP).  Once on the Internet, any user can put up a web site.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				While traditional broadcast media such as CNN and ABC News do have online versions<span class="Footnote" title="Footnote: "><a href="#ftn5" id="body_ftn5">[5]</a></span>, the web contains millions of amateur pages.  Many ISP’s will host their customers page’s for free.  In addition, companies such as Yahoo and MSN have created virtual online communities that contain the home pages of hundreds of thousands people.  In fact, the tradition of web surfers constructing their own home pages predates the existence of large professional sites run by big corporations.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The technological reality that every web surfer is a potential content provider as well as a consumer has had a profound effect on how freedom of expression issues are viewed on the Internet.  In general, the Internet community views free speech as a fundamental right and believes that freedom of expression – especially unpopular messages – must be protected.  It is possible to put this lofty ideal into practice on the Internet due to its ability to support an unlimited number of “channels”.  Unlike a newspaper where space is a limiting factor, or a television news broadcast where time is a limiting factor, on the Internet there is no limit to the number of views that can be expressed.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The result of this approach to freedom of expression is that in addition to the exceedingly large number of worthwhile sites on the Internet, there are also areas that contain material that is offensive to the vast majority of humans.  One way of approaching this issue is to think of the Internet, once called “the information superhighway”, literally as a type of highway.  Highways can take you to many fascinating and informative destinations – if you so choose.  They can also take to you to places that are not so pleasant.  The choice is yours.<span class="Footnote" title="Footnote: "><a href="#ftn6" id="body_ftn6">[6]</a></span>
