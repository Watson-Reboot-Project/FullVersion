				While copyright protects the interests of the authors or owners of a work for a limited period of time, the doctrine of “fair use” places some restrictions on that copyright protection, in order to protect the rights of consumers and the general public. 	
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Consumers have a basic right to access and enjoy copyrighted works they have lawfully licensed.  Consumers also have some limited rights to share access to their lawfully licensed copyrighted works with others, as long as they are not making a profit in doing so.  These rights mean you can loan your copy of your favorite novel to your best friend, or invite “the gang” over to watch a DVD without violating copyright law.  Consumers also have limited rights to record, for personal use, audio and video broadcasts that they have obtained legal access to.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The rights of researchers, reporters, scholars, teachers, and librarians are also protected by fair use.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The doctrine of “fair use” was first established in the United States by the Supreme Court in 1841 by their decision in “Folsom v. Marsh”.  As with copyright protection, the “fair use” doctrine has been modified numerous times in judicial rulings and legislative acts to broaden its scope and address new technologies.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The Copyright Act of 1976 states in Section 107: “the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords … for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright.”
			</p>
			
			<p>
				In the 1984 decision, “Sony Corporation of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.”, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled by a 5-4 majority that noncommercial home use recording of material broadcast over public airways was a fair use of copyrighted works and did not constitute infringement.  This ruling established the legal right of consumers to “time shift” television programs using VCRs.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The Audio Home Recording Act of 1992 reaffirmed the consumers’ right to use (and retailer’s right to sell) analog and digital audio recording devices.  In order to discourage the illegal production of high quality digital copies, digital recording devices such as Digital Audio Tape, DAT, recorders were required to include a Serial Copy Management System, or SCMS, that would only permit first generation digital-to-digital copies.  Such a system allows a DAT to be made from a CD or first generation DAT, but does not permit a second generation DAT (copy of a copy) to be produced.  Analog recording devices, such as traditional audio tape recorders, were explicitly exempted from the SCMS requirement.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				In June of 1999, The United States 9<sup>th</sup> Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that use of portable MP3 players, such as the iPod, does not violate copyright law.  The decision was based on the fact that these devices do not fit the definition of “digital recording device” specified in the 1992 law.  MP3 players cannot record songs, only play them back.
