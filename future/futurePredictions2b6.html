				As we have seen, the aim of virtual reality is complete immersion in a virtual world. In <span class="Bolded">Augmented Reality</span>, or AR, the user can see the real world, but in addition computer technology is used to enhance or “augment” what the user sees. The most commonly discussed form of AR employs a mobile heads-up display together with position and orientation sensors capable of detecting where the user is and where he or she is looking. Given this interface, a computer will be able to superimpose computer generated virtual objects on top of the real-world scene.
			</p>

			<p>
				The best known example of AR technology to date is Google Glass. As I write this chapter in late 2013, Google Glass is still in beta but is already generating lots of interest as well as lots of controversy. Some people think the technology looks geeky, and at this point they are right. But with improving technology, the sensors, display device, and computer hardware should soon fit into truly lightweight glasses. I believe that while there may be some initial resistance, within 10 to 15 years most people, including you, will probably wear some form of AR gear.<span class="Footnote" title="Footnote: "><a href="#ftn17" id="body_ftn17">[17]</a></span>
			</p>

				Such technology has great potential for enhancing the world around us. For example, consider what happens when you have to make a connecting flight in a large and unfamiliar airport. Right now, we look up our flight number or destination city on airport monitors to find what gate our flight leaves from, then we check a map of the airport terminal, and finally make our way to the gate. With a properly programmed AR system, all you would have to do is follow the big green arrow that appears to be floating in mid air and it will lead you to your gate. Of course, only you would be able to see this arrow. Other travelers would see their own arrows leading them to their flights.
			</p>

			<p>
				For another example, consider a chemistry class in which everyone is wearing AR gear. When the professor discusses sulfuric acid, the entire class would be able to see the H<a class="Subscript">2</a>SO<a class="Subscript">4</a> <!-- <img align="bottom" alt="" src="../Images/The%20Past%2C%20Present%2C%20and%20Future%20of%20Computing_html_m393ccfee.gif" /> --> molecule floating in mid air. Everyone could watch as simulations of chemical reactions took place all around them. The 3-D geometry of molecules and the role of reaction catalysts would be obvious.
			</p>

			<p>
				Despite the obvious benefits of AR technology, there is concern about its social implications – especially since Glass has a forward facing camera that can take pictures and record video. In fact, due to the potential for abuse, Google has announced that it will not develop face recognition applications for Glass.<span class="Footnote" title="Footnote: "><a href="#ftn18" id="body_ftn18">[18]</a></span>

				<a href="#body_ftn17" id="ftn17">[17]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;And don’t worry about looking like a geek. AR glasses will come in designer styles and be thought of as very cool.
			</p>

			<p class="Footnote">
				<a href="#body_ftn18" id="ftn18">[18]</a>&nbsp; This author hopes Google will change its stance on facial recognition as people become more familiar with the technology, since he is one of those individuals who can’t remember people’s names and would welcome a technology that would simply superimpose names directly beneath people’s faces.
