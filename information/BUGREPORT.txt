# Bugs

- Issues w/ doing multiple exercises is back
  - after answering a exercise, the resultant relations display in the ebook. so far so good.
  - after answering a second figure, the first figure no longer displays correctly
  - the problem is in init/export functions in figure/editor files `DatabaseApp.js`.
  - should be creating separate relation lists for each exercise in `sessionStorage`
