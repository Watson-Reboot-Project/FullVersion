      <p>
        Sometimes we are interested in retrieving particular columns, or attributes, of a table, rather than retrieving particular rows, or tuples. Perhaps a list of faculty names and phone numbers is needed; or a list of student names and addresses.
      </p>

      <div>
        The</span> <span class="Bolded">project</span> operator</span><span class="Footnote_20_Symbol"><span class="Footnote" title="Footnote: Pronounced “pro -ject”, as in “projector”."><a href="#ftn4" id="body_ftn4">[4]</a></span></span> is used to retrieve particular attributes, or columns, from a relation. For example,</span>
      </div>

      <p class="Subfigure">
        Project Fname, Phone from Faculty
      </p>

      <p>
        would produce the relation shown in <span class="figNum projectfaculty"></span>. This newly generated relation contains an entry for each row, or tuple, in its parent relation, “Faculty”. However, only the specified attributes, namely “Fname” and “Phone”, are included.
      </p>

      <p>
        The general format used in this book for the “project” query is:
      </p>

      <p class="Subfigure">
        Project</span> <span class="Italicized">attribute_list</span> from</span> <span class="Italicized">relation
      </p>

      <p>
        where the field “relation” will be replaced with the name of an existing relation, and “attribute_list” will be replaced by a comma separated list of attribute names.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="figNum coursesrelation"></span> presents another relation from our university database. This relation, the “Courses” relation, contains information about the university’s course offerings. The relation would contain an entry for every section of every course ever offered. Each row, or tuple, of this relation includes the name of the faculty member who taught the course, the sequence number of the particular section, the name of the course, the quarter and year offered, and the number of credit hours the course is worth.
      </p>

      <!-- <img src="images/projectfaculty.png" alt="Results of Project Fname, Phone from Faculty" class="Image"> -->

      <div id='project1'></div>

      <p class="Figure">
        <span class="figNum projectfaculty"></span> Results of Project Fname, Phone from Faculty
      </p>

      <!-- <img src="images/coursesrelation.png" alt="The “Courses” relation – part of a university database" class="Image"> -->
      <div id='Courses'></div>

      <p class="Figure">
        <span class="figNum coursesrelation"></span> The “Courses” relation – part of a university database
      </p>

      <p>
        Given the “Courses” relation, a list of course names and the credit hours they are worth can be generated by the following relational query:
      </p>

      <p class="Subfigure">
        Project Course, Credits from Courses
      </p>

      <p>
        The results of this query are presented in <span class="figNum projectcourses"></span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note that the relation of <span class="figNum projectcourses"></span> contains only eight tuples, whereas there are eleven tuples in its parent relation, “Courses”. The reason for this discrepancy is that duplicate entries have been eliminated. Relations are generally considered to “sets” of tuples, and as such, duplicate entries are not allowed. “Project” operations often generate tables that contain some duplicate rows, but most relational database packages will delete these duplicates automatically.
      </p>

      <!-- <img src="images/projectcourses.png" alt="Results of Project Course, Credits from Courses" class="Image"> -->

      <div id='project2'></div>

      <p class="Figure">
        <span class="figNum projectcourses"></span> Results of Project Course, Credits from Courses
      </p>

      <p>
        As with “select”, the relation produced by a “project” operator can be assigned a name so that it can be referred to in subsequent relational operations. For example,
      </p>

      <p class="Subfigure">
        Names_and_addresses &#8592; Project Sname, Address, City, State from Students
      </p>

      <p>
        would place student names and address information (street address, city, and state) into a relation named “Names_and_addresses”.
      </p>

      <p>
        In summary, the “project” operator creates a new relation that consists of a subset of the columns, or attributes, of an existing relation. Every tuple of the parent relation will contribute to the projected relation, but duplicate rows will be deleted. Unlike “select”, there is no condition test associated with “project”. Remember to use the “project” operator when you are interested in retrieving particular fields of a relation.
