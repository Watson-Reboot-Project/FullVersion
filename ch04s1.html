				4.1 Introduction
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Compared to other human endeavors, the history of computing is relatively short.   In addition, the field evolves quite rapidly.  Thus, there are many questions of a societal nature that have not been fully settled.  This chapter explores some of the social, legal, and ethical issues raised by the widespread application of computing and communications technologies.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Do you have a legal right to record police as they question and/or arrest an individual; and is it ok for you to post such videos to YouTube?  Are you responsible for all of the Internet traffic that passes through your wireless router?  Is it wrong for supermarkets to collect data on their customers and to sell that data to marketing agencies?  Does free speech extend to the right to post and view erotic images online?  Should it be considered ok for two friends to swap MP3 music files?  Do ordinary people have the right to freely exchange messages written in unbreakable codes?  Ought computing professionals be licensed, like doctors, lawyers, and accountants?			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				In this chapter we will examine these and other questions, which are being actively debated by our society.  The presentation is divided into two parts.  The first part of the chapter looks at issues that are relevant to the general public.  The second part of the chapter focuses on issues of concern to computing professionals.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				We live in an exciting time â€“ a time in which the basic laws defining personal privacy, freedom of expression, intellectual property rights and protections, and what constitutes criminal behavior in the online world are being drafted by legislatures and tested in the courts.  Citizens of representative democracies owe it to themselves to become educated about these issues, so that they can help shape the direction of future laws.
