				2.1 Introduction
			</p>
	
			<p>
				This chapter examines how ordinary people, or “end-users”, use computers to enhance communication and solve problems.  The focus of the chapter is on productivity or work related applications, rather than on recreational uses such as game playing.  
			</p>

			<p>
				Section 2.2 provides some background by briefly describing how computers have changed the way we work, and how those changes have not always been in the directions predicted.  Section 2.3 follows with overviews of a number of common end-user communication applications.  Section 2.4 focuses on a single application, the spreadsheet, and examines how this general-purpose modeling tool can be used to help solve a variety of common problems.
			</p>
	
			<p class="Section">
				2.2  The changing role of computers
			</p>
	
			<p>
				Without computers modern life would be all but impossible.  Computers keep track of our bank accounts. They power ATMs, generate our paychecks, print billing statements, and produce most of the “junk mail” we wade through.  They enable us to purchase food, clothing, and other items with credit and debit cards.  They allow monetary funds to be transferred, stocks to be traded, and airline reservations to be booked.  They help engineers design and build airplanes, automobiles, roads, and bridges.  They enable scientists to study distant planets, understand DNA, and model new drugs.  In fact, computers have become so much a part of modern life one wonders how engineering, business, or science was ever conducted without them.
			</p>
	
			<p>
				In the not too distant past, only highly trained professionals used computers.  Today, large numbers of people use computers on a daily basis for tasks such as email, instant messaging, web browsing, word processing, creating and giving presentations, spreadsheet modeling, and information storage and retrieval.  In order to understand how we reached this point and, perhaps, where we are headed, it is useful to look back at how computing has changed the way we work.  
			</p>
	
			<p>
				Large mainframe computers transformed the way business was conducted in the late 1960’s and 1970’s, automating most record keeping, accounting, and billing operations.  With the advent of personal computers and networks in the 1980’s, businesses were transformed once again, becoming more decentralized and receptive to individual customer needs.  By the 1990’s, computers had become inexpensive and common enough for most employees to have immediate access to them, once again changing the way business was conducted.  The first decade of the 21<span class="T10">st</span> century is witnessing the rise of wireless and mobile computing – extending network connectivity beyond the desktop and promising to once again fundamentally change the way we work and live.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				Although the magnitude of these changes has been quite large, it is interesting to note that much of this change has occurred in unexpected directions and that some expected changes have failed to materialize.  For example, in the late 1970’s, the Xerox Corporation funded advanced research into how computers would be used in business settings in the coming decades.  The Altos research project conducted at PARC, the Palo Alto Research Center, focused on developing prototype tools for the “paperless office.”  The idea was that when computers could be used for creating documents, and networks for transmitting them, there would no longer be a need for paper in offices.  This was, of course, a concern for Xerox, since their major business was producing photocopiers.  
			</p>
	
			<p>
				While the Altos project led to many advances, such as graphical user interfaces and mouse pointing devices, that are in common use today, the anticipated “paperless office” never really arrived.  In fact, with the widespread availability of high quality laser printers and the ability to quickly update manuscripts with word processors, paper consumption has increased rather than decreased.
			</p>
	
			<p>
				Some people think that eventually paper will lose its dominant role as a medium for recording and disseminating information.  They point out that computers are still relatively expensive, not yet universally available, and suffer from a lack of software standards.  Others believe that paper will continue to be cheaper and more portable for the foreseeable future.  
			</p>
	
			<p>
				Regardless of whether paper eventually goes the way of the dinosaur or not, one of the lessons of the Altos project is that progress in computing does not always proceed in easy to predict ways.  As we take a look at the applications that are currently popular, you should try to keep this fact in mind.  Even as recently as a decade ago two of today’s most popular end-user applications – web browsers and presentation software – didn’t even exist.  Thus, the applications you will be using ten years from now are likely to be very different from the ones that are popular today.
			</p>
			
			<p class="Section">
				2.3   Communication-oriented applications
			</p>
	
			<p>
				This section provides an overview of five of the most common end-user communication-oriented applications.  The phrase “end-user” is used to signify that these applications are intended for use by the general public.  A “communication-oriented” application is one whose primary purpose is to enable humans to communicate with one another.
			</p>
	
			<p>
				The five applications examined in this section are:
			</p>
	
			<ul>
				<li>Email,</li>
				
				<li>Instant messaging,</li>
				
				<li>Web browsers, </li>
				
				<li>Word processors, and</li>
				
				<li>Presentation software.</li>
			</ul>
	
			<p>
				All of these applications aim to enhance human communication. This is an amazing fact when one considers that computers were originally conceived of as “number crunchers” whose only function would be to perform complex calculations as rapidly as possible.  
			</p>
	
			<p class="Section">
				2.3.1 Email 
			</p>
	
			<p>
				Electronic mail, or <span class="Bolded">email</span>, applications enable people to exchange text messages over networked computer systems.  Email is a convenient and efficient way to communicate that has become vital to the conduct of business over the past decade.  Email programs, such as Microsoft’s Outlook, integrate email functionality with related productivity applications such as address books, calendars, and scheduling applications.
			</p>
	
			<div >
				In order to be able to send or receive email messages, a user must have an email account and access to a networked computer.  Every email account has an account name associated with it.  These account names are often based on the user’s real name in work environments<span class="Footnote" title="Footnote: Many companies adopt strategies for assigning email account names, such as “last name first initial” to make it easier to associate employees with their email accounts."><a href="#ftn1" id="body_ftn1">[1]</a></span> and on nicknames or “handles” in recreational environments.  For example, my name is Mike O’Neal, so one would expect my email account to be named something like “mike” or “onealm”.
			</div>
	
			<p>
				An email account name, when combined with the name of the computer network on which it resides, becomes an <span class="Bolded">email address</span>.  Email addresses usually take the form <span class="Ital">account_name</span>@<span class="Ital">computer_network</span>.  My university email account is named “mike” and resides on Louisiana Tech’s network.  Since that network is named “latech.edu”, my email address is <a href="mailto:mike@latech.edu"><span class="Internet_20_link">mike@latech.edu</span></a>.
			</p>
	
			<p>
				Anyone with an email account of their own and access to the Internet can send messages to my email address.  Regardless of whether the sender is in the office next door or half way around the world, the message will be delivered to my account almost immediately.  
			</p>
	
			<p>
				If I am logged in to the computer network, I will be immediately notified when mail arrives – usually by a quiet chime or beep.  Unlike a phone call, I can choose to either read and respond to the message immediately, or wait for a more convenient time.  If I am not logged in when the message arrives, the system will hold the email and notify me that mail is waiting the next time I log in.  This ability to “hold” messages, allows busy individuals to side step time consuming and frustrating games of phone tag.<span class="Footnote" title="Footnote: You know, the game where I call you but you are not in, so I leave a message for you to call me back. Then you call me, but I am not in, so you leave a message for me to call you. Then I call you… and the game continues until we both eventually connect. "><a href="#ftn2" id="body_ftn2">[2]</a></span>
			</p>
	
			<p>
				Email can also provide a record of all messages sent to or from an account.  While it is true that telephone conversations can be recorded, this is not usually done.  Even if it were done regularly, the recordings would be difficult to search.  Most email programs include searching, sorting, and archiving functions that make it relatively easy to track down a particular email message – even one exchanged months or years ago.  
			</p>
	
			<p>
				Another important feature of email is its ability to support attachments.  <span class="Bolded">Attachments</span> are data files included in an email message.  Some common attachments are: electronic copies of documents, images, sound files, and video.  The ability to send copies of a document via email often leads to productivity gains in the workplace, since email is much faster and cheaper than alternative methods of transmitting documents, such as fax or photocopy and express mail.
			</p>
	
			<p>
				In addition to facilitating one-on-one communication, email is also an excellent means for rapidly communicating with a group of people.  Sending an email message to ten people is often just as simple as sending it to one.  For this reason, email is generally the preferred way for members of a group to communicate with one another.  Due to the ease of sending out messages to groups of people, physical, paper-based memos are rapidly becoming a thing of the past in many offices.
			</p>
	
			<p>
				A final, relatively recent, aspect of email is the rise of “web-based email” or “web mail”.  Traditional email applications, such as Microsoft Outlook, are programs that run on an end-user’s computer.  These programs connect to networked email servers in order to send outgoing email and download incoming email.  In contrast, web-based email such as HotMail or Yahoo Mail, is completely server based and accessed via a web browser.  
			</p>
	
			<p>
				Because there is no email program to install, configure, and run, web mail can be accessed from any web-enabled computer.  The big advantage of web mail is that it is quite convenient.  The down side is that the features of web mail tend to be more limited than those available on traditional email applications.  For example, web mail accounts tend to have limits on the size of messages that can be sent and on the total size of the user’s mailbox.  They may not handle attachments as smoothly as traditional email applications.  Web mail also tends to have less sophisticated search and archive features than traditional email applications and is often not as well integrated with address book, calendar and scheduling applications.
			</p>
	
			<p class="Section">
				2.3.2 Instant messaging applications
			</p>
	
			<p>
				<span class="Bolded">Instant Messaging</span> clients, or IM clients, support the sending and receiving of typed messages along with the exchange of data files.  In this manner, IM clients are similar to email programs.  However, instant messaging systems also support “presence”, which means a user can see which of his or her IM contacts (sometimes called “buddies”) are online and the status of each (e.g., idle, away, busy, available for chat, etc.).  Popular IM clients include: AOL Instant Messenger, Yahoo Instant Messenger, MSN Messenger, ICQ, and Trillian.  
			</p>
	
			<p>
				As opposed to email, instant message conversations take place in near-real-time.  Individual IM’s tend to be quite short – a single question or statement.  These brief typed messages are exchanged back and forth between two individuals in a manner similar to the way utterances are exchanged in face-to-face or telephone conversations.  You type a message.  It pops up on your buddy’s desktop.  She types a message.  Her response pops up on your desktop. You reply. Etc.
			</p>
	
			<p>
				While almost as immediate as a telephone conversation, instant messages are far less intrusive.  If the recipient of an IM is busy, he or she does not have to respond immediately.  Unlike a ringing telephone, an IM can be momentarily ignored.  
			</p>
	
			<p>
				Instant messaging products, such as ICQ and AOL Instant Messenger, were originally conceived of as “recreational” applications that would enable Internet users to chat with one another.  These applications have proven so useful that many businesses have adopted the technology in order to enhance productivity.  
			</p>
	
			<p>
				Telephone, instant messaging, and email are now seen as providing a spectrum of communication options that increase the effectiveness of communication in the work environment by providing mechanisms for prioritizing the urgency of a directive or information request based on its level of intrusiveness – email for routine communications, instant messages for more pressing matters, telephone and face-to-face conversations for highest priority items.
			</p>
	
			<p class="Section">
				2.3.3 Web browsers
			</p>
	
			<p>
				Web browsers, such as Microsoft’s Internet Explorer and Netscape’s Communicator, enable people to view and navigate “web pages” over the Internet.  Web pages are similar to the pages of a magazine in that they consist primarily of text and color graphics.  But unlike magazine pages, web pages can contain other types of content, such as sound, animations, and video.  Another difference is that individual web pages may be linked to other web pages forming a vast network, or “web”, of such pages.  End users move from one web page to another by clicking the mouse on an appropriate word, phrase, or image that is linked to the target page.
			</p>
	
			<p>
				More precisely, a <span class="Bolded">web browser</span> is a computer program that interprets and displays documents written in the HyperText Markup Language, or <span class="Bolded">HTML</span>.  The <span class="Bolded">web</span>, or World Wide Web, is the vast collection of interconnected HTML documents, or web pages, that are delivered via the computers and networks of the Internet. 
			</p>
	
			<p>
				<span class="Bolded">Web pages</span> are HTML documents that generally combine three technologies: multimedia, hypertext, and programming logic in the form of JavaScript.  <span class="Bolded">Multimedia</span> refers to the ability to include multiple kinds of media, such as text, graphics, photos, and audio, in a single document.  <span class="Bolded">Hypertext</span> is the ability to jump from document to document by clicking on highlighted objects – such as words or pictures – that appear within the page.  <span class="Bolded">JavaScript</span> is a programming language that is understood by most web browsers.  
			</p>

			<img src="Images/fig2-1.png" alt="A web document as it appears using Netscape’s Communicator browser" class="Image">
		
			<p class="Figure">
				Figure 2.1:  A web document as it appears using Netscape’s Communicator browser
			</p>		
		
			<p>
				JavaScript code can be embedded directly into web pages giving them limited program-based functionality.  JavaScript tends to be used to do simple things, such as presenting an input form to a user and then checking data as it is entered by the user to ensure that it is of the appropriate type and within expected ranges.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				Beyond these basic technologies, web browsers can be upgraded via plug-ins.  A <span class="Bolded">plug-in</span> is a computer program that extends the capabilities of a web browser beyond its original abilities.  Plug-ins enable web browsers to recognize additional types of media such as video or Flash animations.  Plug-ins can also extend web browsers in other ways, such as enabling them to interpret Java Applets. 
			</p>
		
			<p>
				Figure 2.1 shows what Louisiana Tech University’s main web page looks like when viewed with Netscape Communicator on a Windows PC.  Notice that in addition to text, this page contains graphics, such as the Tech logo, and photographs.  On the left of the page is a list of topics.  In order to find out more information about some aspect of the school, such as the Lady Techsters basketball team, simply click on the appropriate item, (e.g., “athletics”) and follow the appropriate links (e.g., women’s basketball).
			</p>
		
			<p>
				In addition to being used for recreational and general informational purposes, web browsers have become important productivity tools in the workplace.  One reason for this is that the underlying document formatting language used by the web, HTML, is a “platform neutral” way of representing information.  “Platform neutral” means that an HTML document will look pretty much the same regardless of whether it is viewed using Netscape’s Communicator or Microsoft’s Internet Explorer, and regardless of whether the browser is run on a Mac, a PC, or a Unix workstation.  HTML is important because it allows companies to create documents once and be assured that they can be viewed by employees regardless of the type of computer they have on their desk or which browser they happen to be using.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				More and more companies are constructing internal webs.  These webs contain the documents, such as manuals, procedures, training materials, and newsletters; that are essential for a company to function.  Internal webs often exist on <span class="Bolded">intranets</span>, which are private networks used to connect together the computers and sub-networks of a company or organization.  Intranets are distinct from the <span class="Bolded">Internet</span>, which is a publicly accessible worldwide network of networks.  In addition to being private, intranets may also support much higher bandwidths, making the delivery of streaming video for employee training practical and applications such as video conferencing possible.
			</p>
		
			<p class="Section">
				2.3.4Word processors
			</p>
		
			<p>
				For vast majority of the 20<span class="Superscript">th</span> century the three essential pieces of office equipment were the telephone, the typewriter, and the filing cabinet. The last decade of the 20<span class="Superscript">th</span> century saw this list change to the telephone, the computer, and the laser printer.  Typewriters have now all but vanished from most offices, replaced by computers running word processors and inexpensive high-quality laser printers.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				A <span class="Bolded">word processor</span>, such as Microsoft Word, is a computer program that can be used for typing and editing documents.  In addition to supporting basic text entry, most word processors include spell checking and grammar checking tools, numerous formatting options, fonts, and page layout features, plus the ability to include images and create simple drawings and graphics.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				Word processors were able to so quickly replace typewriters because of their many advantages.  Typewriters were designed for one purpose, typing documents.  Word processors on the other hand, are usually just programs running on general-purpose personal computers.  This arrangement is much more flexible since the computer can be used for many things other than typing, like accessing a database or performing spreadsheet calculations.  
			</p>
		
			<p>
				Word processors also make the process of correcting typographical errors much easier than with a typewriter.  On a typewriter, once a key had been struck, the character was actually printed on paper.  While it was reasonably easy to correct simple mistakes on a good quality typewriter, even those often left some traces of the original error.  More substantial corrections, such as inserting a missing word, sentence, or paragraph, were impractical, even on the best typewriters.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				In addition to the increased flexibility and improved ability to correct mistakes, word processors allow documents to be automatically formatted in various styles, such as a memo, letter, or report.  Word processors can also automatically generate page numbers, place footnotes at the bottom of a page and number them, create indices, tables of content, and lists of figures; plus a host of similar operations that make creating large documents, such as a book, much easier to do.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				Another important feature of word processors are their ability to perform spell checking.  Spell checking is possible because a dictionary is included with the word processing program.  When a document is spell checked the computer compares every word in the document against the entries in its dictionary.  Words that appear in the document but not in the dictionary are flagged as possibly incorrect.  For each of these possibly misspelled words, the word processor can present a list of one or more suggested corrections.  This list consists of dictionary words that are “similar” to the unmatched word that appears in the document.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				For example, when I type “incomptable” my word processor marks it as incorrect, using a red underline, and offers two suggestions: “incomputable” and “incompatible”.  Most of the time the word you meant to type is listed among the suggestions. But this is not always the case. 
			</p>
		
			<p>
				Occasionally, word processors will mark a correct, but uncommon, word as “incorrect”.  For example when I type the word “tribble” my word processor marks it as misspelled and offers the following suggestions: (1) treble, (2) dribble, (3) gribble, (4) terrible, and (5) trebled.  As any fan of the original Star Trek series can tell you, there is nothing wrong with the word “tribble”.  Tribbles are cute furry little creatures that breed prodigiously.  However, since “tribble” is not a very common word, it is not included in the standard dictionary that comes with my word processor.  If I intended to use this word frequently, I could add it to my word processor’s dictionary so that it could recognize the word. 
			</p>
		
			<p>
				Towards the end of the 1990’s popular word processing programs, such as Microsoft Word, began augmenting their traditional spell checking tools with an “autocorrect” feature.  Autocorrect monitors the user’s keystrokes and automatically corrects a large number of common typographical errors.  For example, Microsoft Word automatically changes the characters “teh” to the word “the” immediately after the spacebar is hit following the “h”.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				Just as word processors may sometimes mark a correct word as “incorrect”, they may also occasionally fail to mark a word that is incorrect.  The most common reason for this is that the word is properly spelled but improperly used.  For example, if I type the sentence:
			</p>
		
			<p class="Subfigure">
				“You must finish you dinner.”
			</p>
		
			<p>
				when I meant to type:
			</p>
		
			<p class="Subfigure">
				“You must finish your dinner.”
			</p>
		
			<p>
				my word processor does not complain.  It fails to realize that the second “you” should in fact be “your”.  The sentence “Hay there.” passes muster as well, even though most people immediately realize that “Hey there.” is what was meant. 
			</p>
		
			<p>
				My word processor does somewhat better on the following sentence:
			</p>
		
			<p class="Subfigure">
				“There leaving there keys over their.”
			</p>
		
			<p>
				which should be:
			</p>
		
			<p class="Subfigure">
				“They’re leaving their keys over there.”
			</p>
		
			<p>
				The program points out a potential problem with the first “there” (by underlining it in green).  If I take the program’s suggestion of “They’re”, it then points out a problem with the second “there”.  If I also take the program’s suggestion of “their” for that word, it then points out a problem with the final word in the sentence and offers “there” as an alternative.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				These kinds of errors (the ones that show up as green underlines in Microsoft Word) are generated by the word processor’s grammar check feature.  Grammar checkers can sometimes catch improper word usage errors, but their advice is usually less reliable than the advice offered by spell checkers.  
			</p>
		
			<p>
				Although grammar checkers are useful and their capabilities are improving,<span class="Footnote" title="Footnote: For example, the grammar checker used by Word ’95 could not handle the “They’re leaving their keys over there.” example properly, while the grammar checker included with Word 2000 can."><a href="#ftn3" id="body_ftn3">[3]</a></span> they are unlikely to become as reliable as spell checkers anytime soon. The reason has to do with the fact that word processors have no understanding of the meaning of the words being typed.  Instead, grammar checkers use a collection of simple rules, like the kind you studied in high school, together with information on the parts of speech to which individual words can belong.  Such systems can catch some simple errors, like subject verb number agreement, but they miss many other errors, and occasionally mark grammatically correct sentences as incorrect.
			</p>
		
			<p class="Section">
				2.3.5 Presentation software
			</p>
		
			<p>
				Up until the past few years, scientific, technical, and even most business presentations used very few visual aids.  The three immutable features of professional presentations the world over were: the speaker, the overhead projector, and a stack of transparencies.  The transparencies were usually simple black and white outlines of the talk, predominately consisting of text with few graphics or images.  In this simpler time, the amount of effort the speaker had put into preparing the talk could usually be discerned by noting whether the transparencies were hand written or had been prepared on a word processor.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				These days, such presentations are passé.  Professional presentations now routinely include an audiovisual slideshow, generated by a laptop computer connected to a portable display device such as a projector.  The computer programs used to create and deliver the audiovisual aids for such presentations are known as <span class="Bolded">presentation software</span>, or presentation graphics programs.  One of the most popular programs of this type is Microsoft’s PowerPoint.
			</p>
		
			<img src="Images/fig2-2.png" alt="A slide taken from a PowerPoint presentation" class="Image">
		
			<p class="Figure">
				Figure 2.2:  A slide taken from a PowerPoint presentation
			</p>
		
			<p>
				Presentation software allows end-users to create professional looking presentations that include text, graphics, high-resolution color photographs, sound effects, and music; together with narration and even limited amounts of video.  In addition, visual effects such as “fades” between slides, panning and zooming, and rotation of images and text are usually supported.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				Figure 2.2 contains an image of a slide taken from a PowerPoint presentation.<span class="Footnote" title="Footnote: The slide comes from a presentation originally given by Bill Gates, Chairman of Microsoft, and posted to the web. "><a href="#ftn4" id="body_ftn4">[4]</a></span>  While a still image cannot convey the dynamic aspects of such a presentation, it is possible to get a good feel for the types of media (text, graphics, and photographs) that can be included.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				Presentation software packages have become an indispensable communication tool redefining the “look” of professional presentations, but like most tools they must be properly used to increase productivity.  Two common mistakes that can negatively affect productivity are: (1) devoting an excessive amount of time to creating a presentation, and (2) loading a presentation down with attractive “eye candy” that distracts the audience and hinders their ability to concentrate on the point of the presentation.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				As presentation packages have become more and more sophisticated, in many ways creating professional looking presentations has become easier, thus saving time and increasing productivity.  However, it is also the case that as more and more capabilities have been added to presentation software, there has been an increasing temptation on the part of end-users to construct more and more elaborate presentations – adding animations, narration, video clips, etc.  As the “bar” of what is considered an acceptable presentation is raised, many professionals find themselves devoting increasing amounts of time to generating more and more elaborate presentations.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				Certainly, there are times when a presentation needs to look as “slick” as possible.  And no one would argue that the use of photos, charts, and animation are not, on occasion, critical to getting an idea across to an audience.  However, indiscriminant use of these features does little to improve a presentation.  In fact, features such as animated text and sound effects often do more harm than good – detracting from the speaker’s message by drawing the audience’s attention away from the substance of the talk.  
			</p>

				2.4  Spreadsheets
			</p>
		
			<p>
				In the preceding section of this chapter, we took a quick look at a number of communication-oriented applications.  In this section, we examine spreadsheets, a problem-solving application, in detail.  Learning about spreadsheets will help set the stage for our discussions of programming that follows later in the book.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				<span class="Bolded">Spreadsheet</span> programs, such as Microsoft Excel, are general-purpose modeling tools that allow end-users to represent a problem as a collection of data items and the formulas that express the relationships between those items.  Spreadsheets are used extensively in business, science, and engineering to visualize data (e.g., display sales figures in bar charts and pie charts), to analyze data (e.g., compute sums and averages), and to help answer “what if” type questions (e.g., “What will happen to profitability if wages are increased by 10%?” or “What will happened to payload capacity if overall vehicle mass can be reduced by 5%?”).
			</p>
		
			<p>
				Many people consider spreadsheets to be the single most important application that led to the widespread adoption of PCs by businesses in the early 1980’s.  Dan Bricklin and Bob Frankston developed the first spreadsheet program, VisiCalc, in 1978.<span class="Footnote" title="Footnote: A brief history of spreadsheets is available at: http://www.dssresources.com/history/sshistory.html. "><a href="#ftn5" id="body_ftn5">[5]</a></span>  Prior to its development, data analysis was either done by hand – using pencil, paper, and a calculator – or required the use of special-purpose computer programs.  These programs had to be designed, written, debugged, and tested – a time consuming and expensive process.  With a spreadsheet, budgets and financial forecasts that took weeks to prepare the old fashioned way could be created in a few hours.  This dramatic rise in productivity easily justified the cost of a computer and software.
			</p>
		
			<p class="Section">
				2.4.1 Basic features of a spreadsheet<span class="Footnote" title="Footnote: I have endeavored to keep this discussion of spreadsheets as generic as possible, avoiding references to particular products, such as Microsoft Excel. However, occasionally “implementation specific” details cannot be avoided. In such cases the details presented conform to the way the Watson Spreadsheet Lab works. When these details differ from Microsoft Excel’s way of doing things, the differences are pointed out in a footnote such as this."><a href="#ftn6" id="body_ftn6">[6]</a></span>
			</p>
		
			<p>
				A spreadsheet consists of a rectangular grid, or table, of “cells.”  The table is divided into horizontal rows (usually numbered 1, 2, 3, etc.) and vertical columns (usually labeled A, B, C, etc.).  The location of each cell in the table can be specified by its column letter and row number.  For example, the upper-left-most cell of a spreadsheet is labeled A1, since its location is column A, row 1.  Cell locations are always specified with the column designator listed first, followed by the row designator.  
			</p>
		
			<img src="Images/fig2-3.png" alt="A simple spreadsheet" class="Image">
		
			<p class="Figure">
				Figure 2.3:  A simple spreadsheet
			</p>
		
			<p>
				A small spreadsheet containing four columns and eight rows is shown in Figure 2.3.  Notice that the word “Grades” is stored in cell B2.  The value “100” is stored in cell C3.  In order to use a spreadsheet program effectively, the first task you must master is to become comfortable with the cell reference system.
			</p>
			<p>
				Each cell of a spreadsheet may hold one of three things: a number, a text string, or a formula.  <span class="Bolded">Numbers</span> are generally composed of the digits 0 through 9 together with an optional decimal point and sign.  Hence, “50”, “50.0”, “+50”, and “+50.0” are all valid ways of representing the number fifty.<span class="Footnote" title="Footnote: Spreadsheet programs differ in their abilities to handle numeric data that contains special symbols (e.g., “$” and “,”). While all spreadsheets will recognize “50000” and “75” as numbers, some programs will not accept “50,000” and “$75” as numeric data. The Watson Spreadsheet lab generally does not allow special characters in numeric data. Newer versions of Microsoft Excel do allow some special symbols in numeric data."><a href="#ftn7" id="body_ftn7">[7]</a></span>
			</p>
		
			<p>
				The standard way that values are entered into a spreadsheet cell is to click the mouse on that cell and then type in the value to be inserted.  For example, the value of “50” could have been placed into cell C2 of the spreadsheet of Figure 2.3 by first clicking on the cell and then typing “50” followed by the “enter” key.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				Even though spreadsheets are primarily used to manipulate numbers, there is often a need to include text in the table for such things as titles and column headings.  In general,<span class="Bolded"> text strings</span> may consist of any sequence of typeable characters<span class="Footnote" title="Footnote: The primary restriction in both the Watson Spreadsheet lab and Microsoft Excel is that text strings may not begin with an equals mark “=” since that character is used to identify formulas."><a href="#ftn8" id="body_ftn8">[8]</a></span>.  As an example, consider the cell B2 in the spreadsheet of Figure 2.3, which contains the character string “grades”.  Similarly, cell B6 holds the text string “average.”
			</p>
		
			<p>
				The final type of item that can be stored in a spreadsheet cell is a formula.  <span class="Bolded">Formulas</span> are used to represent mathematical expressions that are to be calculated.  As a result, they look and behave very similar to standard mathematical expressions.  At a minimum, every spreadsheet program will support the four basic mathematical operators: addition, denoted by “+”; subtraction, denoted by “-”; multiplication, usually denoted by “*”; and division, denoted by “/”.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				In addition to the mathematical operators, formulas may contain the numbers upon which the operators are to act.  Hence, <span class="Subfigure">= 5 * 3</span> and <span class="Subfigure">= 1 + 2 + 3</span> are both valid spreadsheet formulas<span class="Footnote" title="Footnote: The Watson Spreadsheet Lab and Microsoft Excel both require that all formulas being with an equal sign “=” in order to distinguish them from text strings."><a href="#ftn9" id="body_ftn9">[9]</a></span>.  In general, formulas are evaluated from left to right with all multiplication and division being performed before any addition or subtraction.  So,  <span class="Subfigure">= 1 + 2 + 3</span>  is computed as  1 + 2  giving  3, followed by  3 + 3  giving 6.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				Just as with mathematical expressions, parenthesis may be used to override this default ordering and force operations to be performed in any order you desire.  So,  <span class="Subfigure">= 1 + (2 + 3)</span> would be evaluated as 2 + 3 giving 5, followed by 1 + 5 giving 6.
			</p>
		
			<p class="Section">
				2.4.2 Formula evaluation: a closer look
			</p>
		
			<p>
				While spreadsheet formulas and mathematical expressions are quite similar, one difference between the two is that spreadsheet formulas use cell references, rather than variables like <span class="Ital">X</span> and <span class="Ital">Y</span>.  There are other differences as well.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				In order to begin to understand these differences let’s consider how we would go about constructing a spreadsheet that would convert a temperature expressed in degrees Celsius into one expressed in degrees Fahrenheit.  The standard equation that expresses the relationship between these two temperature scales is:
			</p>
			
			<ul class="Blockcenter">
				<img src="Images/fig2-fahrenheit.png" alt="">
			
			</ul>
			<p>
				This expression cannot be entered directly into a spreadsheet for two main reasons.  First, it refers to the variables <span class="Ital">F</span> and <span class="Ital">C</span> rather than to spreadsheet cell locations, and second the expression is an equation.  The first point is rather obvious; the second point is subtle but important.  Mathematical equations are essentially statements of fact, which say that two quantities are equal.  Spreadsheet formulas, instead of expressing equivalence, specify a sequence of mathematical operations that are to be performed.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				In order to construct a spreadsheet to perform temperature conversions from Celsius to Fahrenheit, we must first decide which spreadsheet cell will contain the input – the temperature in degrees Celsius – and which cell will hold the output – the same temperature expressed in degrees Fahrenheit.  Let’s say that we decide to place the input in cell B2 and would like the result to be placed immediately below it, in cell B3.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				Under these conditions, B2 will take the place of <span class="Ital">C</span> in the above expression.  But, what about <span class="Ital">F</span>?  It will not appear directly in the formula.  Instead, B3, the cell corresponding to <span class="Ital">F</span>, will be the cell in which we place the formula that describes <span class="Ital">how </span>to perform the temperature conversion.  Specifically, the following formula will be placed in cell B3:
			</p>
		
			<p class="Subfigure">
				= 9 / 5 * B2 + 32
			</p>
			
			<p>
				This formula instructs the spreadsheet to divide 9 by 5 and then multiply the result by whatever value is stored in cell B2, and finally to take that result and add 32.  The final result of this computation will then be displayed in the cell that contains the formula, cell B3 in this case.  
			</p>
		
			<p>
				Note that the symbol for multiplication must be included between <span class="Subfigure">9 / 5</span> and B2.  Even thought he rules of algebra allow multiplication to be implied by writing two quantities next to one another, spreadsheets require that all multiplication operations be explicitly indicated by the “*” symbol.  Many people familiar with spreadsheet formulas would also add parentheses around <span class="Subfigure">9 / 5</span>, giving <span class="Subfigure">= (9 / 5) * B2 + 32</span>, to make the formula easier to read, even though the parentheses are not strictly required in this case.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				The above example is illustrated in Figure 2.4.  The number 0 is stored in cell B2, in order to represent an input of zero degrees Celsius.  Cell B3 holds the formula that will compute the equivalent temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.  In order to improve the readability of the spreadsheet, the text strings “Celsius” and “Fahrenheit” have been placed in cells C2 and C3, respectively.  Note that this example includes all three types of data that a spreadsheet may hold: numbers, formulas, and text strings.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				It is important to clearly understand that cell B3 in the spreadsheet of Figure 2.4 contains a formula and not a number. The value 32 is displayed in cell B3 because that is the value currently being computed by the formula stored in the cell.  In order to see the formula underlying a cell, simply click on the cell.  In Figure 2.4 cell B3 has been highlighted and its underlying formula is displayed immediately above the spreadsheet.
			</p>

			<img src="Images/fig2-4.png" alt="A spreadsheet for converting temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit" class="Image">
		
			<p class="Figure">
				Figure 2.4:  A spreadsheet for converting temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit
			</p>
		
			<p>
				At this point it would be natural to think to yourself, “Wow, that was a lot of work to go through just to show that 0 degrees Celsius is equal to 32 degrees Fahrenheit.”  And you would be right if that was all this spreadsheet could do.  
			</p>
		
			<p>
				The power of spreadsheets lie in their ability to automatically recalculate and update values that depend on other values.  In the case of the current example, changing the value stored in cell B2 will cause the formula in cell B3 to be recomputed.  So, if the value of 100 were placed in B2, the value displayed in B3 would automatically change to 212.  The Fahrenheit equivalent of <span class="Ital">any</span> temperature expressed in degrees Celsius can be computed just as easily – simply enter the temperature in Cell B2.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				Another example of spreadsheet formulas can be found by returning to Figure 2.3.  The spreadsheet of Figure 2.3 computes the average of three grades, stored in cells C2, C3, and C4, and places the result into cell C6.  Since the average of three grades is given by the equation: 
			</p>
		
			<ul class="Blockcenter">
				<img src="Images/fig2-average.png" alt="average formula">
			</ul>
		
			<p>
				the formula: 
			</p>
		
			<p class="Subfigure">
				= ( C2 + C3 + C4 ) / 3
			</p>
		
			<p>
				should be entered into location C6.  The parentheses are a critical part of the formula in this case, since all three grades must be added together and then that sum divided by 3.  If the parentheses had been omitted, only the last grade, C4, would have been divided by three.  This is due to the fact that division has a higher precedence than addition and so would be performed first.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				In order to be able to work with spreadsheets effectively, it is important that you fully understand operator precedence.  <span class="Bolded">Operator precedence</span> specifies the order in which the individual mathematical operations that make up a formula are to be performed.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				Figure 2.5 summarizes the priorities of the most common spreadsheet operators.  Using this information, let’s take a closer look at exactly how a spreadsheet formula is evaluated. 
			</p>

			<p class="Figure">

			<p class="Figure">
				Figure 2.6:  The evaluation of the spreadsheet formula  <span class="Subfigure">= 9/5 * B2 + 32</span>
			</p>
		
			<p>
				The process of evaluating a formula may be envisioned as scanning the formula from left to right for priority one operations, stopping to perform each operation that is encountered, and then repeating this process for priorities 2 through 5.<span class="Footnote" title="Footnote: In reality, a more efficient evaluation method that does not require multiple passes over the formula is generally used. While the details of that method are beyond the scope of this chapter, be assured that the method described here will always return the correct result."><a href="#ftn10" id="body_ftn10">[10]</a></span>
			</p>
		
			<p>
				As mentioned above, a temperature can be converted from Celsius to Fahrenheit using the formula: = <span class="Subfigure">9 / 5 * B2 + 32</span>, assuming cell B2 contains the input temperature in degrees Celsius.  The first step in computing a value from this, or any other, formula involves resolving all cell references and function calls in a left to right manner.  This formula contains only a single reference, to cell B2, and no function calls.<span class="Footnote" title="Footnote: For the moment, discussion of functions is deferred."><a href="#ftn11" id="body_ftn11">[11]</a></span>  So, the reference to B2 can be replaced with the value currently stored in that cell.  Let us assume 100 is the value currently stored in B2.  Our formula has now been reduced to  = <span class="Subfigure">9 / 5 * 100 + 32</span>.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				Next the formula must be scanned for parentheses.  None are found so we consider priority 4 operations: multiplication and division.  The first such operation encountered in a left to right scan is “/”, so <span class="Subfigure">9 / 5</span> is evaluated, producing 1.8.  The formula has thus been reduced to = <span class="Subfigure">1.8 * 100 + 32</span>.  The operation <span class="Subfigure">1.8 * 100</span> is performed next, leading to the formula = <span class="Subfigure">180 + 32</span>.  As there are no more priority 4 operations, we move on to priority 5 and find one remaining operation to be performed.  The operation <span class="Subfigure">180 + 32</span> is carried out to produce the final result of 212.  Figure 2.6 summarizes this computation.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				As alluded to above, the order in which the operations of a formula are carried out can dramatically affect the final computed value.  This concept is illustrated further in Figure 2.7.  As can be seen in the figure, = <span class="Subfigure">5 + 1 / 6 + 3</span> evaluates to 8.167, since the division is performed first, followed by the two addition operations, in left to right order.  Placing parentheses around <span class="Subfigure">5 + 1</span> leads to the formula = <span class="Subfigure">( 5 + 1 ) / 6 + 3</span> which evaluates to 4, and so on.  When multiple sets of parentheses appear in a formula they are evaluated from left to right, as can be seen in the example = <span class="Subfigure">( 5 + 1 ) / ( 6 + 3 )</span> which is equivalent to the fraction <span class="Subfigure">6 / 9</span> or 0.667.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				Parentheses may also be nested to create more complex expressions.  For example, the expression 
			</p>
		
			<ul class="Blockcenter">
				<img src="Images/fig2-complex.png" alt="">
			</ul>
		
			<p>
				can be represented by the formula:    <span class="Subfigure">= 5  * ( ( A1 + 3 ) / ( A5 – 3 ) )</span>.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				When sets of parentheses are nested within one another, the rule is to evaluate them from the innermost set to the outermost set.  Hence, if A1 is 5 and A5 is 7, the above formula evaluates to 10.
			</p>
			
			<ul class="Blockcenter">
				<li><span class="Subfigure">= 5 * ( ( 5 + 3 ) / ( 7 – 3 ) )</span></li>
				<li><span class="Subfigure">= 5 * (     8     / ( 7 – 3 ) )</span></li>
				<li><span class="Subfigure">= 5 * (     8     /     4     )</span></li>
				<li><span class="Subfigure">= 5 * 2</span></li>
			</ul>
		
			<br/>

			</p>
		
			<p>
				As we have just seen, the ability to work with formulas is what makes spreadsheets so useful.  Because they are so powerful, formulas must be used with care or problems may result.  One of the most common problems involving spreadsheet formulas occurs when the user makes a typographical error while entering the formula.  For example, if the user entered  = <span class="Subfigure">A1 // 3</span>  rather than  = <span class="Subfigure">A1 / 3  </span>the spreadsheet program would flag the entry as an error, since it would not know how to interpret two slashes following one another. 
			</p>
		
			<p>
				A more subtle problem occurs when the user enters a valid formula, but one which computes a different quantity than expected.  For example, a valid formula for averaging three grades, stored in C2, C3, and C4, is  = <span class="Subfigure">( C2 + C3 + C4 ) / 3</span>.  To compute an average in this way, parentheses must be used to force the sum of the grades to be computed before the division by the number of grades.  What happens if the parentheses are accidentally omitted?  Will the spreadsheet program warn you?  Unfortunately, no.  Since = C2 + C3 + C4 / 3 is a valid formula (albeit one that does not compute an average) the spreadsheet program will be happy to compute it for you.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				When working with spreadsheets, try to always keep in mind that the spreadsheet program doesn’t really know <span class="Ital">what</span> you are trying to do.  It will compute any formula you give it; whether or not that formula really yields the value you are interested in.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				Another error that can occur while working with formulas has to do with the contents of the cells referenced by the formula.  If a formula refers to a cell that does not yield a valid number, then that formula cannot be computed and will thus be marked as an error.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				For example, a formula to compute the average of three grades is shown in cell C6 of part (a) of Figure 2.8.  This formula depends on cells C2, C3, and C4 yielding valid numbers.  If the contents of C2 were replaced by a text string, the average could not be computed and the spreadsheet program would mark the formula in cell C6 as in error.  As soon as a number was once again entered into cell C2, the error condition would be resolved and the spreadsheet program would immediately compute a value for C6 from its formula.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				Note that it is only necessary that a cell referenced by a formula <span class="Ital">yield</span> a number, not that it directly contain a number.  Hence, it is possible (and is quite often the case) that a cell referenced in a formula will itself contain a formula.  For example, the spreadsheet of Figure 2.8 computes a student’s final grade in a class by averaging together three grades: the grade on exam 1 (stored in cell C2), the grade on exam 2 (stored in cell C3), and the average grade made on all homeworks (computed in cell C4).  The homework grade is, in turn, computed as the average of four individual homework grades, stored in cells F2, F3, F4, and F5.

				The above spreadsheet would be very useful when playing that “what if” game students are so fond of as finals draw near.  Just plug in the homework and exam grades and see what the final grade will be.  “Let’s see, what if I really buckle down and score a “100” on that last homework and a “95” on the final exam…”

				2.4.3 Relative and absolute cell referencing
			</p>
		
			<p>
				A feature that adds to the flexibility of spreadsheets is their ability to move or copy the contents of cells from one location in a table to another.  This feature is best explained by reference to an example.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				Figure 2.9 reproduces the spreadsheet for converting temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit that was first introduced in Figure 2.4.  Part (a) of the figure shows the actual contents of the cells, while part (b) shows the values that would be displayed.  Notice that the only cells that are being used in this table are B2, B3, C2, and C3.  When referring to a rectangular collection of cells, called a <span class="Bolded">block</span> of cells, normally only the upper left hand cell and the lower right hand cell are listed.  So, in this case, the cells of interest are in the block B2-C3.  Parts (c) and (d) of Figure 2.9 show the cell contents and displayed values that would result from “moving” block B2-C3 to block A1-B2.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				Comparing part (b) of the figure to part (d), we can see that the “move” operation does exactly what we would expect it to do.  It moves the spreadsheet for temperature conversions to a different portion of the table.  However, a careful comparison of parts (a) and (c) will reveal that “move” involves more than at first meets the eye.  When the formula  = (9/5) * B2 + 32 stored in cell B3 was moved to cell A2, it was modified to read = (9/5) * A1 + 32.  While this change might at first seem perplexing, it is necessary in order to allow the temperature conversion spreadsheet to work properly at its new location in the table.  If the formula had not been modified, it would be in error after the move, since cell B2 no longer holds the temperature to be converted.

				Figure 2.10:  An illustration of relative cell referencing
			</p>
		
			<p>
				When performing a move or copy operation, numbers and text strings are copied to their new location without change.  However, when moving or copying a formula, a technique known as relative cell referencing is usually used.  <span class="Bolded">Relative cell referencing</span> treats the references to cells in a formula as being relative to the current location of that formula.  For example, if a formula located in cell A2 makes reference to cell A1, that reference is interpreted to mean the cell immediately above the current cell.  It is this relative location that is preserved in a move or copy operation.  If the formula were moved to location B3 then the cell reference would be changed to B2, so that after the move the formula still refers to the cell immediately above it.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				This concept of relative cell referencing is further illustrated in Figure 2.10, which shows how a formula that is located in cell B3 would be modified if copied to C7.  In its original location, the formula appears as = <span class="Subfigure">A1 + C2</span>.  Since cell A1 is located two cells up and one cell to the left of cell B3, when the formula is moved or copied to C7 this reference is changed to B5.  Note that B5 is exactly two cells up and one cell to the left of C7.  Likewise, the reference to cell C2 in the original formula, which is one cell up and one cell to the right of B3, will be changed to D6 when the formula is moved to C7 since D6 is one cell up and one cell to the right of C7.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				As we have seen, relative referencing gives us the flexibility to freely move a spreadsheet to any location in the table.  Most of the time, relative cell referencing is what we want.  However, there are occasions when it is useful to be able to “lock” a cell reference in a formula to a particular location.  This is called absolute cell referencing.  In <span class="Bolded">absolute cell referencing</span>, even if the formula is moved, the referenced cell will not change.

				Absolute cell referencing comes in most handy when there are one or more values that will be referenced in many different formulas.  For example, say you were constructing a financial spreadsheet that dealt with employee salaries.  It is likely that the current federal, state, and local income tax rates would be used in many calculations throughout the entire spreadsheet.  Placing these rates in fixed cells and having all formulas that use these rates refer absolutely to those cells would be a very good idea.  This is because tax rates inevitably change over time.  When a tax rate increases, the only change that will have to be made to the spreadsheet will be to insert the new rate in the appropriate cell.
			</p>

			<p class="Figure">
				Figure 2.11:  An illustration of absolute verses relative cell referencing
			</p>
		
			<p>
				If you had instead chosen to treat the tax rates as constants and embed them directly in the underlying formulas, then whenever a rate changed you would have to find and change every formula in the spreadsheet that used that rate.  
			</p>
		
			<p>
				Constructing formulas that refer to the tax rates using relative cell referencing would be better than using constants, but still not as good as absolute referencing.  The reason for this is that many formulas are likely to use the tax rate information.  If you used relative referencing, then you would not have the flexibility to move the formulas around in the table.  Every time you tried to move a formula that referred to a tax rate, relative referencing would corrupt your formula.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				One common way of indicating that cell references are to be absolute is to place a dollar sign symbol in front of both the column and row designators.  For example, if we wanted the reference to cell A1 to be absolute instead of relative, we would write $A$1.  Figure 2.11 illustrates the effect of moving a formula that contains both absolute and relative references.  The original formula, located in cell B3, contains an absolute reference to cell A1 and a relative reference to cell C2.  After a move to cell C7, the absolute reference to cell A1 remains unchanged, while the relative reference is modified to point to D6.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				One final point about cell referencing.  As you know, a cell reference consists of two parts: the column reference and the row reference.  It is possible to refer to one of these absolutely and the other relatively.  For example, $A1 “locks” the column reference but allows the row reference to remain relative.  C$2 works in the opposite manner, allowing the column reference to be relative while forcing the row to remain fixed.  
			</p>
		
			<p>
				Figure 2.12 illustrates the effect of “mixed” cell references.  As in the previous two figures, the formula originally located in cell B3, refers to cell A1 and C2, and is moved to cell C7.  The reference to A1 is $A1, which locks the column to “A”, but allows the row reference to remain relative.  Since row 1 is two rows above row 3, when the formula is moved to row 7 the referenced cell will be on row 5 (two rows above row 7).  Hence the complete reference will be $A5.  The reference C$2 is handled in a similar manner, except the row is locked to 2, while the column is relative (one column to the right of the current cell).

			<p>
				In the preceding discussion, the terms “move” and “copy” were used somewhat interchangeably.  This is because both operations handle cell contents in the same way.  The only difference between the two is that “move” erases the contents of the source cells after performing a copy operation.  Hence, after a “copy” there will be two instances of cell contents: the original (source) contents, and the copied (destination) contents.  After a “move” there will be only one instance of the cell contents, in the destination location.

				2.4.4 Miscellaneous features:  “replicate” and built-in functions
			</p>
		
			<p>
				When working with spreadsheets it is frequently the case that a column (or row) of the spreadsheet will contain a large number of very similar formulas.  For example, Figure 2.13 illustrates a spreadsheet used to calculate the effect of a projected 10% raise on employee’s salaries.  Column A contains the names of the employees.  Column B contains the salaries for the current year (which is given as 2215)<span class="Footnote" title="Footnote: A reviewer of a previous draft of this text commented “why the weird years?” I take it he or she was not a Star Trek fan."><a href="#ftn12" id="body_ftn12">[12]</a></span>.  Column C contains the salaries for the following year (2216).  An examination of Column C reveals that all of the formulas in cells C2 through C6 have the same general form: multiply the contents of the cell immediately to the left of the current cell by 1.1.  These formulas have the effect of computing a 10% raise.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				What is the best way of entering these formulas into the spreadsheet? 
			</p>

			<p class="Figure">
				Figure 2.13:  A spreadsheet for calculating a 10% employee pay increase
			</p>
		
			<p>
				The most straightforward way of entering the formulas is to type each one by hand.  While this method is obvious, it is also time consuming.  
			</p>
		
			<p>
				A far better approach would be to use the “copy” and “paste” features built into most spreadsheet programs.  Interestingly, spreadsheet programs generally allow you to copy the contents of a single cell to the “clipboard” and then paste the contents of that cell into an entire block of cells simultaneously.  In addition, if the content of the cell being pasted is a formula, that formula’s relative cell references will be respected.  This combination of features often turns out to be very useful.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				For example, to produce the raises shown in column C of Figure 2.13 a sequence of actions similar to the following could be executed.  Type the original formula <span class="Subfigure">= B1 + 1.1</span> into cell C2, then click on the cell, and select the “copy” operation.  Next, highlight the block of cells beginning at C3 and ending at C6 – by clicking on cell C3 and dragging the mouse to cell C6.  Finally, click “paste”.  <span class="Ital">All</span> of the cells from C3 to C6, inclusive, will be filled with copies of the formula in cell C2 (modified in the standard way).
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Another feature common to most spreadsheets is built-in functions.  Built-in functions provide a convenient way of expressing frequently used computations – especially computations that involve references to large blocks of cells.  For example, most spreadsheet programs include functions for computing the “sum” and “average” of any block of cells.  Without functions, computing the average of the values in cells C1 through C10 would require the user to enter a formula such as:
			</p>
		
			<p class="Subfigure">
				= ( C1 + C2 + C3 + C4 + C5 + C6 + C7 + C8 + C9 + C10 ) / 10
			</p>
		
			<p>
				Imagine how long the formula would be if we needed to average the contents of 50 cells values rather than just ten.  Besides requiring a lot of typing, such an approach is prone to error.  For example, the user must make sure he or she correctly counts the number of items to be averaged – if the sum is divided by the wrong number of items, the computed result will be incorrect.  
			</p>
		
			<p>
				A common way of expressing functions is to list the function name followed by an indication of the block of cells the function will act on, usually listed in parenthesis.  For example the function to average the contents of cells C1 through C10 might take the form:
			</p>
		
			<p class="Subfigure">= AVG(C1:C10)</p>
		
			<p>
				where AVG is the name of the average function, and C1:C10 indicates that C1 is the first cell in the row or column to be averaged and C10 is the final cell<span class="Footnote" title="Footnote: In Microsoft Excel, the name of the average function is “AVERAGE”. Thus, this function would be expressed as = AVERAGE(C1:C10) . "><a href="#ftn13" id="body_ftn13">[13]</a></span>.   While this formula could be typed directly into a cell, it can also be created by highlighting the block of cells from C1 to C10, selecting “average” operation, and then clicking on the target cell that is to contain the average of cells C1 through C10.e

			2.4.5 Solving problems with spreadsheets
			</p>
		
			<p>
				Now that we have a good idea of the nuts and bolts that make up spreadsheet programs, it is time to turn our attention to the question of how spreadsheets can be used to solve “real-world” problems.  As mentioned above, one of the primary uses of spreadsheets is to answer “what if” type questions.  One such question that all undergraduates are interested in is “What will be my grade be if I make X on the final?”  Let’s construct a spreadsheet to help answer this question.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				The first thing we need to know in order to create a spreadsheet is what the input data will be, what outputs are expected, and what mathematical relationships will exist between the inputs and the outputs.  For the problem of computing a course average, we know, in general, that the inputs will be exam and homework grades and that the output will be the final average.  The relationships that exist between these inputs and outputs are usually specified by the instructor’s grading policy.  Here is a grading policy similar to the one I use in my artificial intelligence course:
			</p>
		
			<p class="Blockcenter">
				There will be three exams given this quarter.  Exams one and two will each be worth 20% of your final course grade.  Exam three will be worth 30%.  Homework will be worth a total of 30% of your final course grade.  Four homework assignments will be given this quarter.  All exams are graded on the 100 point scale.  Homeworks will be graded on a 20 point scale.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				From this grading policy we can see that there will be exactly four homework grades and three exams.  To begin constructing the spreadsheet, let’s have one column for homework grades and one column for exam grades.  If we select column B for the homework and column D for exams, we might want to label the columns; say, by placing the text string “<span class="Bolded">Homeworks</span>” in cell B2 and “<span class="Bolded">Exams</span>” in cell D2.  We can now place our homework scores in cells B4, B5, B6, and B7.  Exam grades could be stored in cells D4, D5, and D6.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				Remember that there is nothing special about this particular arrangement of the data.  I simply thought that grouping the grades into columns would make the information easier to read.  I also chose to leave blank spaces between the columns to improve readability.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				Now that we have decided where the inputs should go, we can begin to think about computing the averages.  Instead of trying to come up with a complex formula that directly computes the course average, let’s address the task in stages, first computing a homework average, then an exam average, and finally a course average.  
			</p>
		
			<p>
				The homework average can be computed either by using the built-in “average” function or by directly specifying the formula = <span class="Subfigure">(B4+B5+B6+B7)/4</span>.  The exam average cannot be computed in such a straightforward manner due to the fact that all exams are not weighted equally.  Exams 1 and 2 are each 20% of the final grade, while Exam 3 is 30%.  Hence, all three exams together make up only 70% of the overall grade.  These relationships can be captured by the following formula: = <span class="Subfigure">(.2*D4+.2*D5+.3*D6) / .7</span> which expresses the exam average using the 100 point scale.  Each of the exam grades is multiplied by its appropriate weight and summed giving the number of points earned from exams.  This value is then divided by 0.7, since the total number of points earnable on exams is 70% of total possible points.  For convenience sake, I’ve placed the formula for computing the homework average in cell B9 and the formula for computing the exam average in cell D9.
			</p>
		
			<img src="Images/fig2-14a.png" alt="" class="Image">
		
			<p class="Figure">
				[Note Cell D9 holds the formula <span class="Bolded">= (.2*D4 + .2*D5 + .3*D6) / .7</span>> ]
			</p>
		
			<p class="Figure"> 
				(a) Actual cell contents

			<p class="Figure">
				(b) Displayed values
			</p>
		
			<p class="Figure">
				Figure 2.14:  A spreadsheet for computing an individual student’s course average
			</p>
		
			<p>
				Now that the homework and exam averages have been computed, we can work on combining them to produce the overall class average.  Unfortunately, we cannot simply add the two averages together and divide by two.  The homework average is expressed on a 20-point scale and is worth 30% of the final grade.  The exam average is expressed on the 100-point scale and is worth 70% of the final grade.  
			</p>
		
			<p>
				One approach is to next determine how many of the total points of the final grade will be contributed by homework and how many by exams.  The number of points contributed by the homework average is given by = <span class="Subfigure">B9 / 20 * 30</span>, since B9/20 is the percentage of homework points earned and 30 is the total number of points homework is worth (on the 100 point scale).  Similarly, the number of points contributed by the exam average is:      = <span class="Subfigure">D9 / 100 * 70</span>, since D9/100 is the percentage of exam points earned and 70 is the total number of points exams are worth (again, on the 100 point scale)<span class="Footnote" title="Footnote: Alternatively, the number of total points contributed by the exams could be directly computed from the raw exam scores and the relative weights of each ( i.e., = .2*D4 + .2 *D5 + .3 * D6 ). If this approach were used to compute the value of D10, then the exam average computation in cell D9 could be simplified to = D10 / .7."><a href="#ftn14" id="body_ftn14">[14]</a></span>.  Storing the points earned directly under the averages can be accomplished by placing the formula for homework points in cell B10 and the formula for exam points in cell D10.  Finally, the course average can be computed by adding together the points earned on homework with the points earn on exams: = <span class="Subfigure">B10+D10</span>.  
			</p>
		
			<p>
				Figure 2.14 shows the completed spreadsheet with perfect scores for each of the homework and exam grades.  Additional titles have been added to improve readability, such as “<span class="Bolded">Averages</span>” in cell A9,  “<span class="Bolded">Points earned</span>” in cell A10 and “<span class="Bolded">Final score</span>” in cell A12.  Scale indicators were also added in cells C9 and E9.  These are text strings of the form: “<span class="Subfigure">/20</span>” and “<span class="Subfigure">/100</span>”.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				Now that the spreadsheet formulas have been set up it easy to play the “What will my grade be if...” game.  Simply enter the grades you have made on exams and homeworks that have already been returned and “guesstimate” your grades on the remaining exams and homeworks.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				Hopefully, this example has given you some insight into the process of constructing a spreadsheet to solve a useful problem.  The following exercises provide an opportunity for you to try your hand at a number of different problems.  As is the case with most tools, your proficiency at solving problems with spreadsheets will improve with practice.
