				<span class="Bolded">Instant Messaging</span> clients, or IM clients, support the sending and receiving of typed messages along with the exchange of data files.  In this manner, IM clients are similar to email programs.  However, instant messaging systems also support “presence”, which means a user can see which of his or her IM contacts (sometimes called “buddies”) are online and the status of each (e.g., idle, away, busy, available for chat, etc.).  Popular IM clients include: AOL Instant Messenger, Yahoo Instant Messenger, MSN Messenger, ICQ, and Trillian.  
			</p>
	
			<p>
				As opposed to email, instant message conversations take place in near-real-time.  Individual IM’s tend to be quite short – a single question or statement.  These brief typed messages are exchanged back and forth between two individuals in a manner similar to the way utterances are exchanged in face-to-face or telephone conversations.  You type a message.  It pops up on your buddy’s desktop.  She types a message.  Her response pops up on your desktop. You reply. Etc.
			</p>
	
			<p>
				While almost as immediate as a telephone conversation, instant messages are far less intrusive.  If the recipient of an IM is busy, he or she does not have to respond immediately.  Unlike a ringing telephone, an IM can be momentarily ignored.  
			</p>
	
			<p>
				Instant messaging products, such as ICQ and AOL Instant Messenger, were originally conceived of as “recreational” applications that would enable Internet users to chat with one another.  These applications have proven so useful that many businesses have adopted the technology in order to enhance productivity.  
			</p>
	
			<p>
				Telephone, instant messaging, and email are now seen as providing a spectrum of communication options that increase the effectiveness of communication in the work environment by providing mechanisms for prioritizing the urgency of a directive or information request based on its level of intrusiveness – email for routine communications, instant messages for more pressing matters, telephone and face-to-face conversations for highest priority items.
