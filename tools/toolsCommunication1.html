				Electronic mail, or <span class="Bolded">email</span>, applications enable people to exchange text messages over networked computer systems.  Email is a convenient and efficient way to communicate that has become vital to the conduct of business over the past decade.  Email programs, such as Microsoft’s Outlook, integrate email functionality with related productivity applications such as address books, calendars, and scheduling applications.
			</p>
	
			<p>
				In order to be able to send or receive email messages, a user must have an email account and access to a networked computer.  Every email account has an account name associated with it.  These account names are often based on the user’s real name in work environments<span class="Footnote" title="Footnote: Many companies adopt strategies for assigning email account names, such as “last name first initial” to make it easier to associate employees with their email accounts."><a href="#ftn1" id="body_ftn1">[1]</a></span> and on nicknames or “handles” in recreational environments.  For example, my name is Mike O’Neal, so one would expect my email account to be named something like “mike” or “onealm”.
			</p>
	
			<p>
				An email account name, when combined with the name of the computer network on which it resides, becomes an <span class="Bolded">email address</span>.  Email addresses usually take the form <span class="Ital">account_name</span>@<span class="Ital">computer_network</span>.  My university email account is named “mike” and resides on Louisiana Tech’s network.  Since that network is named “latech.edu”, my email address is <a href="mailto:mike@latech.edu"><span class="Internet_20_link">mike@latech.edu</span></a>.
			</p>
	
			<p>
				Anyone with an email account of their own and access to the Internet can send messages to my email address.  Regardless of whether the sender is in the office next door or half way around the world, the message will be delivered to my account almost immediately.  
			</p>
	
			<p>
				If I am logged in to the computer network, I will be immediately notified when mail arrives – usually by a quiet chime or beep.  Unlike a phone call, I can choose to either read and respond to the message immediately, or wait for a more convenient time.  If I am not logged in when the message arrives, the system will hold the email and notify me that mail is waiting the next time I log in.  This ability to “hold” messages, allows busy individuals to side step time consuming and frustrating games of phone tag.<span class="Footnote" title="Footnote: You know, the game where I call you but you are not in, so I leave a message for you to call me back. Then you call me, but I am not in, so you leave a message for me to call you. Then I call you… and the game continues until we both eventually connect. "><a href="#ftn2" id="body_ftn2">[2]</a></span>
			</p>
	
			<p>
				Email can also provide a record of all messages sent to or from an account.  While it is true that telephone conversations can be recorded, this is not usually done.  Even if it were done regularly, the recordings would be difficult to search.  Most email programs include searching, sorting, and archiving functions that make it relatively easy to track down a particular email message – even one exchanged months or years ago.  
			</p>
	
			<p>
				Another important feature of email is its ability to support attachments.  <span class="Bolded">Attachments</span> are data files included in an email message.  Some common attachments are: electronic copies of documents, images, sound files, and video.  The ability to send copies of a document via email often leads to productivity gains in the workplace, since email is much faster and cheaper than alternative methods of transmitting documents, such as fax or photocopy and express mail.
			</p>
	
			<p>
				In addition to facilitating one-on-one communication, email is also an excellent means for rapidly communicating with a group of people.  Sending an email message to ten people is often just as simple as sending it to one.  For this reason, email is generally the preferred way for members of a group to communicate with one another.  Due to the ease of sending out messages to groups of people, physical, paper-based memos are rapidly becoming a thing of the past in many offices.
			</p>
	
			<p>
				A final, relatively recent, aspect of email is the rise of “web-based email” or “web mail”.  Traditional email applications, such as Microsoft Outlook, are programs that run on an end-user’s computer.  These programs connect to networked email servers in order to send outgoing email and download incoming email.  In contrast, web-based email such as HotMail or Yahoo Mail, is completely server based and accessed via a web browser.  
			</p>
	
			<p>
				Because there is no email program to install, configure, and run, web mail can be accessed from any web-enabled computer.  The big advantage of web mail is that it is quite convenient.  The down side is that the features of web mail tend to be more limited than those available on traditional email applications.  For example, web mail accounts tend to have limits on the size of messages that can be sent and on the total size of the user’s mailbox.  They may not handle attachments as smoothly as traditional email applications.  Web mail also tends to have less sophisticated search and archive features than traditional email applications and is often not as well integrated with address book, calendar and scheduling applications.
